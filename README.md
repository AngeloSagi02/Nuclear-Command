# Nuclear-Command [2018]
Welcome to NUCLEAR COMMAND, I'll explain the rules a bit, continuing through the game you will be presented with choices that you can answer with yes = 1 or no = 2, your reward will be to be able to guess, by reading the various quests, which values will rise and which will go down, here are the 4 resources: Economy, People's Welfare, Army, Radiation. If one of these values reaches 0 or 10, the game ends with your defeat, your task will be to keep everything in balance for as many plays as possible.


This was my first "big" program in c. :)
